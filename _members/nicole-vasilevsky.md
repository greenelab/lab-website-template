Nicole's research focuses on development and application of semantic technologies to facilitate new knowledge discovery and promote scientific reproducibility.
She develops biomedical ontologies and data standards for phenotypes, diseases and other biomedical domains with the goal of improving disease diagnostics and health outcomes.
Given the international focus of this work, she has extensive expertise in working collaboratively on dynamic and dispersed teams and have contributed to a number of consortia and projects.
Other areas of her work include developing methods and best practices with respect to data integration and data quality.
She has made significant contributions to science in the area of scientific reproducibility including demonstrating a lack of uniquely identifying information in methods sections in publications as well as an evaluation of current journal data sharing policies.
With regard to clinical and translational impact, she has contributed to layperson accessible phenotyping standards and clinical phenotyping and disease diagnosis through her work on the Monarch Initiative.
