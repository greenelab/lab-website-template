Curating genomes sparked Moni's current scientific path, and she now manages software development projects aimed at facilitating how we draw insight from genomic and phenomic data across species.
Moni is a highly accomplished genomics scientist with extensive experience at the computer and at the bench.
She is a very experienced project manager, especializing in bioinformatics and genome curation efforts, and has been very successful in building and growing communities around genome curation.
