## BIO

Zach grew up outside of Memphis, TN and completed his BS in Biomedical Engineering-Bioinformatics at the University of Missouri-Columbia. Before coming to BU, he helped develop artificial minichromosome-based gene editing systems in maize with Dr. James Birchler. Later, he studied the long term effects of radiation therapies on sleep electrophysiology and cognition at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital with Dr. Ranganatha Sitaram. At BU, Zach is co-advised with [Mike Economo](https://economolab.org/) and is interested in using state space modeling and subspace methods to study multiregion brain communication. Outside of lab, he enjoys playing soccer and tennis, hanging with his cat Watson, and playing videogames with friends.
