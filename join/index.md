We are currently hiring postdoctoral researchers, research assistants and software engineers.

If you are interested in joining the lab, please [contact Milton Pividori](/contact).


### Graduate students

We are excited to welcome students from any of the [graduate programs]((https://www.cuanschutz.edu/graduate-programs)) offered by the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, in particular, those from the [Computational Bioscience Program](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/graduate-programs/computational-bioscience/home) and the [Human Medical Genetics and Genomics Program](https://www.cuanschutz.edu/graduate-programs/human-medical-genetics-and-genomics/home).

Our teaching philosophy in bioinformatics is based on the philosophy that students need to learn the fundamentals on which modern computational methods are based and apply them in parallel to a real biological problem.
This approach gives both the theory behind a method and insight into what happens in practice when it is applied to a real problem (i.e., how the method deals with noisy transcriptomic data).
This equips students with a deep understanding of all the key pieces, which allows them to successfully apply their knowledge in industry or academia with confidence and innovative approaches.

Please [reach out](/contact) if you have any preliminary questions.
