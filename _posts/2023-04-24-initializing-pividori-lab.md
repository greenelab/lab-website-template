On May 1st, 2023, I will officially start as an Assistant Professor and PI of the [Pividori Lab](/) in the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/dbmi) at the [University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/).

I'm very excited and curious about this new stage in my career.
Our lab will focus on developing machine-learning methods for biomedical informatics, with a specific focus on integrating multi-omics datasets and genetics.
We aim to design the next generation of methodologies that will consolidate large and heterogeneous sources of biomedical data to extract biological insights that will ultimately improve human health.
I invite you to keep an eye on [this blog](/blog), [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/miltondp), and [our projects on GitHub](https://github.com/pivlab) for updates about our research and other activities.

**We are recruiting!** If your interests align with [our labs'](/research), please reach out!
